Creating and Managing Wallets

The following commands in the wallet.ts/.js file should perform the specified operations. ðŸ‘‡

You must create a wallet on Solana with the new command and save the wallet information in the wallet.json file in the same file.

At the same time, the balance of the created wallet should be recorded in the json file.

With the airdrop [X] command, X amount or by default 1 LEFT airdrop will be made.

The balance must be checked for the wallet created in the previous step with the balance command.

The transfer [otherPublicKey][Amount] command must transfer the value entered in the Amount parameter to the wallet address entered in the otherPublicKey parameter, and the result of the transaction should be written on the screen.

This transfer must be made from the wallet address you created in the previous steps.
